.I image [images]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsk_loaddb
loads disk information from 
.I image
to a SQLite database.  This database can then be used by tools in other languages for analysis. By default, the database is stored in the same directory as the image with ".db" appended to the name or the database name can be specified with '-d'. 

The arguments are as follows:
.IP "-a"
Adds image to an existing database instead of creating a new one.  Requires that -d be also specified.
.IP "-d database"
Path for the database (default is the same directory as the image with name derived from image name
.IP -v
verbose output to stderr
.IP -V
Print version
.IP -k
Don't create block data table.  This table maps each block to the file that
allocated it.  This option will make this program run faster.
.IP -h
Calculate MD5 hash value for each file and store it in table.  This option
will make the program run slower. 
.IP "-i imgtype"
The format of the image file, such as raw.
Use '\-i list' to list the supported types.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "-b dev_sector_size"
The size (in bytes) of the device sectors.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "image [images]"
The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '\-i'.
Multiple image file names can be given if the image is split into multiple segments.
If only one image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending in '.001'), subsequent image segments will be included automatically.

.SH EXAMPLES
To load image data from image.dd to image.dd.db:

	# tsk_loaddb ./image.dd
