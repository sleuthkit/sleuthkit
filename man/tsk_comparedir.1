.TH TSK_COMPAREDIR 1 
.SH NAME
tsk_comparedir - compare the contents of a directory with the contents of an image or local device. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tsk_comparedir [-vV] [-n
.I start_inum
.B ] [ -f
.I fstype
.B ] [ -i
.I imgtype
.B ] [ -b
.I dev_sector_size
.B ] [ -o
.I sector_offset
.B ]
.I image [images] comparison_directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsk_comparedir 
compares the contents of
.I image
to the contents of
.I comparison_directory.
This can be useful for detecting rootkits and when testing.  Rootkits can be detected by comparing the contents of a local directory and a local raw device.  The rootkits typically don't hide data when it is read directly from the raw device. 

The arguments are as follows:
.IP "-o sector_offset"
Sector offset for a partition in the image or device to compare with.
.IP "-n start_inum"
Starting inum for a directory in the image to start the comparison at.
.IP -v
verbose output to stderr
.IP -V
Print version
.IP "-f fstype"
Specify the file system type.
Use '\-f list' to list the supported file system types.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "-i imgtype"
The format of the image file, such as raw.
Use '\-i list' to list the supported types.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "-b dev_sector_size"
The size (in bytes) of the device sectors.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "image [images]"
The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '\-i'.
Multiple image file names can be given if the image is split into multiple segments.
If only one image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending in '.001'), subsequent image segments will be included automatically.

.SH EXAMPLES
To compare the directories in image.dd to those in directory:

	# tsk_comparedir ./image.dd ./directory
