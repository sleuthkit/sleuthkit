.I imgtype
.B ] [ -b
.I dev_sector_size
.B ] [ -z

.I seconds
.B ] 
.I image [images]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tsk_gettimes
examines each of the file systems in a disk image and returns the data about them in the MACtime body format (the same as running 'fls -m' on each file system).  The output of this can be used as input to mactime to make a timeline of file activity. The data is printed to STDOUT, which can then be redirected to a file.

The arguments are as follows:
.IP -v
verbose output to stderr
.IP -V
Print version
.IP "-f fstype"
Specify the file system type.
Use '\-f list' to list the supported file system types.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "-i imgtype"
The format of the image file, such as raw.
Use '\-i list' to list the supported types.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.
.IP "-b dev_sector_size"
The size (in bytes) of the device sectors.
If not given, autodetection methods are used.  
.IP "-o sector_offset"
Sector offset for a volume to recover (recovers only that volume)
If not given, will attempt to recover all volumes in image and save them
to different folders. 
.IP "-s seconds"
The time skew of the original system in seconds.  For example, if the
original system was 100 seconds slow, this value would be \-100.  
.IP "-z zone"
The ASCII string of the time zone of the original system.  For
example, EST or GMT.  These strings must be defined by your operating
system and may vary.
.IP "image [images]"
The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '\-i'.
Multiple image file names can be given if the image is split into multiple segments.
If only one image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending in '.001'), subsequent image segments will be included automatically.

.SH EXAMPLES
To collect data about image image.dd:

	# tsk_gettimes ./image.dd > body.txt
