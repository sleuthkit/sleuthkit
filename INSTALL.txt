Optional Libraries:
There are optional features that TSK can use if you have installed
them before you build and install TSK.

INSTALLATION
=============================================================================

Refer to the README_win32.txt file for details on Windows.

The Sleuth Kit uses the GNU autotools for building and installation. 
There are a few steps to this process.  First, run the 'configure'
script in the root TSK directory.

    $ ./configure

If there were no errors, then run 'make'.

    $ make

The 'make' process will take a while and will build the TSK tools.
When this process is complete, the libraries and executables will
be located in the TSK sub-directories.  To install them, type
'make install'.

    $ make install

By default, this will copy everything in to the /usr/local/ structure.
So, the executables will be in '/usr/local/bin'.  This directory will
need to be in your PATH if you want to run the TSK commands without 
specifying '/usr/local/bin' everytime.


CONFIGURE OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some arguments to 'configure' that you can supply to
customize the setup. Currently, they focus on the optional disk
image format libraries.

--disable-afflib: Supply this if you want TSK to ignore AFFLIB even
if it is installed.

--disable-ewf: Supply this if you want TSK to ignore libewf even
if it is installed.
