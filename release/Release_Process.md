SleuthKit 4.13 Release Process
------------------------------

Write release notes
-------------------
Write release notes that do more than summarize the git log (which will be long this time.)


Document updates
----------------

`git log --pretty="%h - %s (%an)" sleuthkit-4.12.0..HEAD`

Testing Code
------------
Final release testing is by Brian Carrier on his personal machine.
- Run regression tests (`tests/reg-test.pl`)
- Compile on Cygwin

Build Unix Tarball
------------------
Run: `release-unix.pl 4.X.X`

NOTE: The above can be done on the Basis computers, but it doesnâ€™t have the GPG key to sign. The process will finish though. Just sign on personal computer after.
Archive the tar ball by moving it from the release directory to a non-git directory (../../release)


Windows Release (after running release-unix, which does tagging)
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Repo can be on develop or wherever. Script does the pull and checkout.
- Get latest version of libewf
- Double click on VS015_cygwin.bat
- Change to the release folder
- Run `./release-win.pl 4.13.0` (version only)
- Verify contents of release directory (sanity check)
  - NOTE: DELETE `Rejistry++ .lib` file - it adds 20MB.
- Copy over to OS X system into release directory for signing
