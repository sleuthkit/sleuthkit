INTRODUCTION
========================================================================
This document contains information on the implementation of the    
FAT file system in The Sleuth Kit.  The Sleuth Kit is based on the  
original designs of The Coroner's Toolkit (TCT), which was designed
only for UNIX file systems.  The FAT file system and UNIX file
systems are very different and this document will identify how      
those differences were handled.  A basic understanding of FAT is 
assumed. 

The major design "decisions" that had to be made are related to:
- Disk unit addressing
- Meta-data addressing



DISK UNIT ADDRESSING
========================================================================
FAT saves file content in clusters.  A cluster is a grouping of
consecutive sectors (512-bytes each).  When a file is described
by the directory entries and File Allocation Table, the cluster
numbers are used as addresses.  The problem, is that cluster 0 is
not at the beginning of the partition.  Cluster 0 is in the Data
Area, which is after the super block and File Allocation Tables 
and can be hundreds of sectors into the partition.  This creates
a problem because if The Sleuth Kit were to use clusters as the 
addressable units, then there would be no way to identify the
non-"data area" sectors.

This problem was solved by making the sector as the addressable
unit, instead of the cluster.  When a file is described (using
'istat' for example), the sector addresses are given.   In the
output of 'fsstat', the File Allocation Table contents are displayed
in sectors and when using 'blkls -l', the sector status is given.

This actually makes manual data recovery easier because one can
use 'dd' to carve out data using the sector addresses.  If clusters
were given, the user would have to translate the Data Area address
to sectors before carving out data.



META-DATA ADDRESSING
========================================================================
FAT describes its files in a directory entry structure, which is
contained in the sectors allocated by the parent directory.  The
directory entry structures have a fixed size of 32-bytes, not
addressed, and can exist anywhere in the partition.  The Sleuth
Kit requires some type of addressing method for meta data structures,
so this became a problem.  Also, the root directory does not have
a directory entry.  In other words, there is no descriptive
information for the root directory.

The solution to this problem was to use the same method that is
used in many UNIX implementations.  Each sector in the data area
is treated as though it could be full of directory entries.  As
each sector is 512-bytes and each directory entry is 32-bytes, each
sector could contain 16 entries.  To keep things similar to UNIX,
the root directory is given the value of 2 (and its meta-data is
set to 0).  The first 32-bytes of the first sector in the data area
are addressed as 3, the second 32-bytes of the sector are 4 etc.
The Sleuth Kit will scan through the sectors and identify which
ones actually contain directory entries.

This method will produce large gaps of addresses between used
address values and places a limit on the size of the partition that
can be analyzed.  The limit is:

	2^32 / 16 = 2^28 sectors

Therefore, we can handle partitions of size 137,438,953,472 bytes.
It is unlikely that FAT file systems will be over 128GB in size.



NOTES ON TIMEZONES
========================================================================
FAT does not store the file times in the delta format that UNIX
does.  Instead of saving the difference in time from GMT, FAT simply
saves the raw hour, minute, and second values.   The Sleuth Kit
stores all times in the UNIX GMT offset format and will translate
the FAT time to the UNIX offset.  This uses the current timezone
value when identify the GMT offset.  

If the tool displays the time in a nice ASCII format, the same
timezone will be used to translate the offset value into a date.
Therefore, you can use any timezone value and the time will not
change (just the timezone name). On the other hand, if you use a
tool such as 'ils' or 'fls -m', which display the time in the offset
format, then it will have the offset of the current timezone or
the one specified with '-z'.  Therefore, ensure that the same '-z'
argument is used with 'mactime' to display the correct time in
the timeline.



GENERAL NOTES ON TIME
========================================================================
Each file in FAT can store up to three times (last accessed, written,
and created).  The last written time is the only 'required' time
and is accurate to a second.  The create time is optional and is
accurate to the tenth of a second (Note that I have seen several
system directories in Windows that have a create time of 0).  The
last access time is also optional and is only accurate to the day
(so the times are 00:00:00 in The Sleuth Kit).
