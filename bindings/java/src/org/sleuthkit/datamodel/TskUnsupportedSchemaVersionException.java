/**
 * Subtype of TskCoreException that is thrown when there is an attempt to open or use
 * a resource with an unsupported schema version.
 *
 * For example, as of Sleuthkit 4.5.0 database schema versions are two part:
 * Major.Minor. This versioning schema is based on semantic versioning, but
 * without using the patch number (in practice it is always the default value of
 * zero). The major part is incremented for incompatible changes such as removing
 * a table or column, i.e., it will not be usable by an older version of the software. A
 * TskUnsupportedSchemaVersionException should be thrown from an attempt to open a
 * db with an incompatible db schema.
 *
 * @see CaseDBSchemaVersionNumber for more details on db schema compatibility.
