/**
 * As of SleuthKit 4.5.0 database schema versions are two part: Major.Minor. 
 * This versioning schema is based on semantic versioning, but without using the
 * patch number (in practice it is always the default value of zero for case database versions).
 *
 * The major part is incremented for incompatible changes, i.e., the case 
 * database will not be usable by an older version. For example, the major 
 * number should be incremented if tables and/or columns are removed, the 
 * meanings of values changes, or new records are added to lookup tables 
 * that will not be convertible to older versions of the corresponding Java 
 * enums.
 *
 * The minor version is incremented for compatible changes that are usable by
 * older versions of the SleuthKit, although the new schema may not be fully taken
 * advantage of. For example, adding an index should be backwards compatible: 
 * an older version of the software will still be able to open and use the case database, but
 * query performance may or may not be affected. Also, adding a column to a
 * table should be backwards compatible as older versions of the software should
 * simply ignore it.
