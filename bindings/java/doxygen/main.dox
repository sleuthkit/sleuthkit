/*! \mainpage The Sleuth Kit Java Bindings Developer's Guide and API Reference

<h3>Overview</h3>

These classes allow Java programs to access data extracted by The Sleuth Kit.

The Sleuth Kit is primarily a C/C++ library and set of command line tools. These classes allow programs to obtain the data that TSK can produce.   The typical steps would be to use JNI to cause the TSK library to create and populate a SQLite or PostgreSQL database.  The Java classes then directly open the database and perform queries on it. 

\section basics Basic

NOTE: This needs to be expanded on.

\subsection basics_add Adding Data to Case

Use SleuthkitCase.newCase() or SleuthkitCase.openCase() to return an instance of a SleuthkitCase object. To add data to the case, use SleuthkitCase.makeAdImageProcess() to get a AddImageProcess object that allows you to populate the database in the scope of a transaction and get feedback on its update process. 

To add a local file (logical file) you can use methods such as SleuthkitCase.addLocalFile(). 


\subsection basics_analyzing Analyzing Data in Case

You can either access files directly using methods such as SleuthkitCase.findFiles() or SleuthkitCase.getAbstractFileById(). 

You can also access the data in its tree form by starting with SleuthkitCase.getImages() and then calling getChildren() on each of the returned objects.  See the section below on basics of the datamodel structure. 


\section jni_hierarchy Class Hierarchy

Flush out here on general layout. 

- org.sleuthkit.datamodel.Content is top-level interface and gets more specific as it goes down.
- Types disk and file system organization concepts (org.sleuthkit.datamodel.FileSystem, org.sleuthkit.datamodel.Image, etc. )
- org.sleuthkit.datamodel.AbstractFile is interface for various types of files with more specific classes below it ( org.sleuthkit.datamodel.DerivedFile, org.sleuthkit.datamodel.FsContent, etc.)
