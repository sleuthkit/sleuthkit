/*! \page artifact_catalog_page Standard Artifacts Catalog


# Introduction
This document reflects current standard usage of artifact and attribute types for posting analysis results to the case blackboard in Autopsy.  Refer to \ref mod_bbpage for more background on the blackboard and how to make artifacts. 

The catalog section below has one entry for each standard artifact type divided by categories. Each entry lists the required and optional attributes of artifacts of the type. The category types are:
- \ref art_catalog_analysis "Analysis Result": Result from an analysis technique on a given object with a given configuration.  Includes Conclusion, Relevance Score, and Confidence.
- \ref art_catalog_data "Data Artifact": Data that was originally embedded by an application/OS in a file or other data container.

NOTE:
- While we have listed some attributes as "Required", nothing will enforce that they exist. Modules that use artifacts from the blackboard should assume that some of the attributes may not actually exist. 
- You are not limited to the attributes listed below for each artifact.  Attributes are listed below as "Optional" if at least one, but not all, Autopsy modules create them.  If you want to store data that is not listed below, use an existing attribute type or make your own.  

For the full list of types, refer to:
- org.sleuthkit.datamodel.BlackboardArtifact.ARTIFACT_TYPE
- org.sleuthkit.datamodel.BlackboardAttribute.ATTRIBUTE_TYPE
