This file describes how to build TSK using Visual Studio (see
README_win32.txt for instructions on building the win32 libraries and
executables from Linux). If you do not have a copy of Visual Studio, you
can use the free Express Edition:

http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

Visual Studio 2010 Express cannot make 64-bit versions of the
executables. To do that, you must download and install an additional SDK:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx

The SDK installation may fail, particularly if Visual Studio 2010 Service
Pack 1 has been installed. In this case, re-run the SDK installer but
un-check the compilers box. After the SDK is installed, run the following
fix to get the 64 bit compiler:

There are six build targets: - Debug_NoLibs and Release_NoLibs do not
depend on any third-party libraries. - Debug and Release depend on libewf
and zlib to be built so that E01 images aresupported. - Debug_PostgreSQL
and Release_PostgreSQL depend on libewf for E01 and PostgreSQL libraries.
This target is needed by Autopsy and other programs that want to write
database results to a central PostgreSQL database instead of just SQLite.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debug and Release Targets


The steps below outline the process required to compile the Debug and
Release targets.

1) Download libewf-20130128 (or later). The official releases are from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libewf/

If you want to build 64-bit libraries though, download a version that
we've upgraded: https://github.com/sleuthkit/libewf_64bit

2) Open archive file and follow the README instructions in libewf to
build libewf_dll (at the time of this writing, that includes downloading
the zlib dll). Note that TSK will use only the Release version of
libewf_dll. Later steps also depend on the zlib dll being built inside of
libewf. Note that libewf will need to be converted to Visual Studio 2010
and be upgraded to support a 64-bit build.

3) Set the LIBEWF_HOME environment variable to point to the libewf folder
that you created and built in step 2.

4) If you want to build libtsk_jni for the Java JNI bindings, then set
the JDK_HOME environment variable to point to the top directory of your
Java SDK.

5) Open the TSK Visual Studio Solution file, tsk-win.sln, in the win32
directory.

6) Compile a Debug, Debug_NoLibs, or Release version of the libraries and
executables. The resulting libraries and executables on a 32-bit build
will be put in win32/Debug, win32/Debug_NoLibs, or win32/Release as
appropriate. A 64-bit build will put them into the win32/x64 folders. You
can change the type of build using the pulldown in Visual Studio and
switching between Win32 and x64.

7) Note that the libraries and executables will depend on the libewf and
zlib DLL files (which are copied to the TSK build directories).



------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL Targets

The steps below outline the process required to compile the
Debug_PostgreSQL and Release_PostgreSQL targets.

1) Follow all of the steps outlined above that are required to build the
Release and Debug targets.

2) Download and install PostgreSQL 9.4 or above. You can either download
the full installer or just the ZIP file. The official releases are from:
http://www.postgresql.org/download/ 
If you want just the ZIP file, you can find them at: 
http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgbindownload 

You will need a 32-bit version to create the 32-bit targets, and a 64-bit
version to create the 64-bit targets. Autopsy relies on TSK, so if you
are going to build Autopsy, match the version of PostgreSQL to the
version of Autopsy you intend to create. If you intend to create both
32-bit and 64-bit Autopsy builds, install both 32-bit and 64-bit
PostgreSQL.

3) Set the POSTGRESQL_HOME_32 and/or POSTGRESQL_HOME_64 environment
variable to point to the PostgreSQL folder containing, but not including,
the bin folder. 
    32-bit Example: POSTGRESQL_HOME_32=C:\Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\9.4 
    64-bit Example: POSTGRESQL_HOME_64=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.4
    
4) Open the TSK Visual Studio Solution file, tsk-win.sln, in the win32
directory.

5) Compile a Debug_PostgreSQL Win32 or x64, or a Release_PostgreSQL Win32
or x64 version of the libraries and executables. The resulting libraries
and executables will be put in win32/x64/Debug_PostgreSQL and
win32/x64/Release_PostgreSQL folders as appropriate. You can change the
type of build using the pulldown in Visual Studio.

6) Note that the libraries and executables will depend on the libewf,
zlib, libpq, libintl-8, libeay32, and ssleay32 DLL files (which are
copied to the TSK build directories).

7) If you are using JNI along with the PostgreSQL build, in NetBeans
build the DataModel PostgreSQL target or in ant 'ant PostgreSQL'.

Refer to the API docs at http://sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/docs/api-docs/
for details on how to use the library in an application.
