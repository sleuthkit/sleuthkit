/*! \mainpage The Sleuth Kit (TSK) Framework User's Guide and API Reference

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  The framework in TSK allows you to write digital forensics applications and easily incorporate a variety of anlaysis techniques using its plug-in modules.  
The framework was also designed to be used in a distributed environment so that jobs could be scheduled among a cluster of computers. 

  If you need only volume and file system-level support, then the original Sleuth Kit library maybe all you need.  If you want an end-to-end solution though, then the framework will help solve your problems. 

  <h3>Basic Concepts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Central Database:</b> All data is stored in a central database, which can be as simple as a local SQLite file or a database server.  The details are hidden from the modules. The TskImgDB class is used to store and retrieve data.</li>

    <li><b>Services:</b> There are core services that the framework provides to the programs that incorporate the framework and to the modules that fit into the framework.  See \ref mod_stuff_services for more details.</li>

    <li><b>Pipelines and Plug-in Modules:</b> The framework provides a pipeline infrastructure that modules can be dropped into.  The framework comes with basic modules, but it is expected that other developers will provide modules that can be used.  See the links below on how to build pipelines and modules.</li>

    <li><b>Three Phases:</b> The framework has been designed on the idea that there are three major phases to the analysis process:
    <ul>
      <li>File Extraction: Where files are identified based on file system data, carving, and other types of data recovery.</li>
      <li>File Analysis: Where each file is analyzed to pull data out of it.  The framework supports plug-in modules to perform file analysis.</li>
      <li>Post Processing / Reporting: Where the results of the individual file analysis are analyzed a file report and analysis tecniques are conducted. The framework supports plug-in modules to perform post processing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

To compile the framework, refer to the <tt>BUILDING.TXT</tt> file that comes with the source code.
