====================================================================
The Sleuth Kit (TSK) runs on Windows.  If you simply want the
executables, you can download them from the www.sleuthkit.org
website.

If you want to build your own executables, you have two options.
One is to use Microsoft Visual Studio.  The VS solution file is in
the win32 directory.  Refer to the BUILDING.txt file in that directory
for details.

You can also compile Windows executables using mingw32.  If you're
using mingw32 on Linux, simply give the "--host=i586-mingw32msvc"
argument when running the './configure' script and use 'make' to
compile.  If you're using mingw32 on Windows, './configure' and
'make' will work directly.

Note that compilation requires a JDK be installed, and by default
the Oracle JDK on Windows is installed in a path such as
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\.  GNU autotools do not handle
paths containing spaces, so you will need to copy the JDK to a
directory without spaces in the name, such as C:\jdk1.6.0_16\, then
add C:\jdk1.6.0_16\bin to $PATH before running './configure'

Note also that libtool may fail on mingw32 on Windows if
C:\Windows\system32 is on $PATH before /usr/bin.  The fix is to have
the C:\Windows directories at the _end_ of your mingw $PATH.
